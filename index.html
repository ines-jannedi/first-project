    <p id="rede">Red roses are a symbol of love, passion, and desire, <br> and are often given as a romantic gesture.

        Red roses are the most popular type of rose. <br> The red rose has been the symbol of love and passion for centuries. <br>
        
        Red roses are native to Asia, Europe, <br> and North America, <br> and have been cultivated for thousands of years. <br>
        
        The color red is associated with strong emotions such as love, <br> passion, and desire, <br> which is why red roses are often given as a romantic gesture.</p> <br>

    <p id="white">Traditionally, white roses are a popular choice for weddings. <br> Because they represent purity, <br>the flower is a wonderful option for marriage celebrations. <br> Besides purity, white roses also represent youthfulness, <br> innocence, young love, and <br> Because of this, <br> white roses are often also viewed as a way to symbolize new beginnings and have come to represent love, <br> much like red roses have done for ages.</p>
    <p id="blue">Blue roses have been known to symbolize mystery, <br> secrecy, and pride. <br> Their rarity, as well as their color, <br> makes them unique among the other flowers in the garden. <br> They are also a popular gift among lovers, <br> who often give them to express their feelings for one another. <br> Nothing is more beautiful than receiving a blue rose bouquet; <br> they are the perfect symbol of romance, beauty, and grace</p>
